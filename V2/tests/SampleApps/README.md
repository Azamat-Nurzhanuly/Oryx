# Sample Apps

In order to test our build and runtime systems, we create our own sample apps as well as use many applications openly available on the web.

Under this directory we keep a collection of such applications, categorized by programming language. Their copyright is attributed in each application directory. 

When they were taken from publicly available repositories on the web, their source is attributed in `SOURCE.md`.
